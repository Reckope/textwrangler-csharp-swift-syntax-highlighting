## Installation

1. Copy the file *swift.plist* and *csharp.plist* to *~/Library/Application Support/TextWrangler/Language Modules*. You may have to create the *Langauge Modules* or *TextWrangler* folder if it doesn’t exist.
2. Quit and relaunch TextWrangler.

Now files with the extension “swift” and “cs”  should be syntax highlighted. The function popup menu in the navigation bar should also list all the declarations in the current file.
